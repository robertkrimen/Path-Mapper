NAME
    Path::Mapper - Map a virtual path to an actual one

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
        my $mapper = Path::Mapper->new( base => '../' )
        $mapper->map( a/b => /apple )

        $mapper->dir( /a/b/xyzzy/ ) # /apple/xyzzy
        $mapper->dir( /a/bxyzzy/ ) # ../a/bxyzzy

DESCRIPTION
    Path::Mapper will map a virtual path to an actual one, doing a
    substitution based on the deepest common directory

    Think of it as doing something like symbolic link resolution (though not
    exactly)

METHODS
  Path::Mapper->new( [ base => <base> ] )
    Create a new "Path::Mapper" object using <base> as the 'root' directory
    (by default, everything is mapped to be under that directory)

  $mapper->base( <base> )
    Change the base directory for $mapper to <base>

  $mapper->map( <virtual> => <actual> )
    Set up a map from <virtual> and anything under (e.g. <virtual>/*) to map
    to the <actual> prefix instead of the usual base

  $mapper->map( <path> )
    Return a 2-element list containing the actual base for this path and the
    path remainder. You probably don't want to use this method

  $mapper->dir( <path> )
    Map the virtual <path> to an actual one and return the result as a
    Path::Class::Dir object

  $mapper->file( <path> )
    Map the virtual <path> to an actual one and return the result as a
    Path::Class::File object

  $mapper->path( <path> )
    Map the virtual <path> to an actual one and return the result as a
    Path::Abstract object
